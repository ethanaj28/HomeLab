My documented journey to obtain my Network+ and next steps into Cybersecurity.
I've experimented with a raspberry pi 4b that was inside of a crypto miner that wasn't in use.
The miner stopped working some time ago, but I wanted to see if the raspberry pi was still functional.
It was still functional until it wasn't anymore. After installing linux, pihole and unbound it finally croaked.

My next move is creating my own router even though I recently purchased a mesh router.
