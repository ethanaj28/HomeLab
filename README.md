My documented journey to obtain my CCNA and next steps into Cybersec.
I have experimented with a Raspberry Pi 4B. I installed Pi-Hole w/ Unbound and used Pi-Hole as an DHCP.
Days later the RPi4B died. Note: This was found inside of a crypto miner I purchased some time ago and it was struggling to work then.

Currently, my plan is to create my own router using a tiny pc.
Instead of using a debian lite OS, I will use pfSense.
